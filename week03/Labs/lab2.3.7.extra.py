# This program adds an integer to a string.
# Author: Betty Attwood

# Question 7: 
# added str before 99 to be able to concate the int with string.
message = 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
print (message)

# Question 8: a variable cannot start with a number

# Question 9:  What three functions can be used to get the integer, 
# floating-point number, or string version of a value?
# The int() , float() , and str( ) functions 
# will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, 
# and string versions of the value passed to them.
