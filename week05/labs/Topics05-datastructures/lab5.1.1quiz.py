# This quiz looks at data types
# I added definitions and citations for items
# that I needed to clarify for myself
# I need further clarify the difference between array and list

# Author: Betty Attwood

# a. numberOfQuestions is an int
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, 
# positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

# b. averageAge is a float 

# c. debugMode is a boolean

# d. name is a str

# e. ages is a array
## how do I know this is an array rather than a list?

# f. months is a tuple with strings inside

# g. months[1] refers to a str (second place in tuple 'Feb')

# h. dict

# i. stuff is an array  containing int, string, boolean, and dict
## how do I know this compared to it being a list

# j. stuff[2] is a boolean expression (refers to third item in tuple False)

# k. someone is a dict

# l. someone["firstname"] str (dict key pulls string value "joe")

# m. me is a dict

# n. me["teaching"] is an array nested within dict
# and containing two keys and corresponding values

# o. me["teaching"] [0] ["semester"] is an int; the key pulls a value of 1
# note: what does the [0] mean? First item in list

# p. me["teaching"] [0] ["coursename"] is undefined due to the spelling:
# as the item in the program has the camelback spelling "courseName" 
# is a key which has the value "programming"
